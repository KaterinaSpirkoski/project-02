## Stapes taken to upload on Github

First of all I clone my main branch of projects into my local computer with comand git clone and paste the https link from Github. After that from main branch I created a new branch and name it as Project_02 with comand git checkout -b plus the name of the new branch.
As soon as i created my new branch I add my project and i added to the staging area with comand add . added them in the .git repo with comand git commit -m "Added project".
As soon as i finished all my changes i push them in Github with command git push.
